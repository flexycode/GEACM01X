Mr. Raffy D. Quines has been an exceptional instructor for the GEACM01X - Advanced Communication course. His expertise in the principles of communication in the workplace has provided students with invaluable insights into effective communication strategies that are essential for professional success.

Throughout the course, Mr. Quines emphasized the importance of ethical communication, highlighting how it builds trust and unity within teams. His lessons on maintaining clear channels of communication and the significance of truthfulness have equipped students with the tools necessary to navigate complex workplace dynamics. This focus on ethics not only enhances our understanding of communication but also prepares us to be responsible and conscientious professionals.

Mr. Quines actively encourages students to practice speaking English during class, which has significantly improved our language skills and confidence in communication. His commitment to fostering a supportive environment where students feel comfortable expressing themselves is commendable. He creates opportunities for us to engage in discussions, share ideas, and practice our speaking skills, which has been instrumental in our development.

Additionally, Mr. Quines introduced us to Lexile reading, which has broadened our understanding of various texts and improved our comprehension skills. This initiative has been particularly beneficial as we prepare for our upcoming speaking engagements, such as my own presentation on "How to Win Friends and Influence People." I feel more equipped to execute this presentation effectively, thanks to the skills and knowledge I have gained in his class.

In summary, Mr. Raffy D. Quines is an outstanding educator who has made a significant impact on his students' communication skills and professional readiness. His dedication to teaching, ethical communication, and language proficiency has not only enriched our learning experience but has also inspired us to strive for excellence in our future endeavors.
